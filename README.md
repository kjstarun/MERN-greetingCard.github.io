Hey Ankit, at this moment of end of the program.
I would like to add some points to you

At first, thank you for upholding such high standards and being an excellent mentor.

Your direction and insightful comments have made me a better professional.I donâ€™t think I can ever thank you enough.

Your dedication even when you have personal issues or feeling low amazes me and inspires me to put in the work.

I'm very bad at decision making when it comes to solving a logical problem. But you made me to think in a right way to see a requirement in the logical problem in a real life manner. Now, not a perfect decision maker. But with your guidance atleast I could make decisions working atmost in technical side.

I would thank you again for the crisp and clear Full Stack program.

Yet, I'll get more challenges when developing a full applications.At that time I'll reach out to you for clarifications at any time.

Thank you for this wonderful journey and have a great time ahead !
